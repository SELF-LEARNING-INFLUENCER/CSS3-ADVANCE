CSS Position
Positioning elements appropriately on the web pages is a necessity for a good layout design
The CSS position property is used to set position for an element. it is also used to place
an element behind another and also useful for scripted animation effect.
You can position an element using the top, bottom, left and right properties. These 
properties can be used only after position property is set first. A position element's 
computed position property is relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.
2.Positon-relative:
A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
In the relative positioning scheme the element's box position is calculated according to 
the normal flow. Then the box is shifted from this normal position according to the 
properties â€” top or bottom and/or left or right.
Note: A relatively positioned element can be moved and overlap other elements, but it keeps 
the space originally reserved for it in the normal flow.
