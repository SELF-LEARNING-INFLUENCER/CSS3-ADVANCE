CSS display is the most important property of CSS which is used to control the layout of 
the element. It specifies how the element is displayed.
Overriding the default display value of an element is an important implication of the 
display property. For example, changing an inline-level element to be displayed as 
block-level element or changing the block-level element to be displayed as an inline-level 
element.
The inline element takes the required width only. It doesn't force the line break so the 
flow of text doesn't break in inline example.The inline value of the display property 
causes an element to behave as though it were an inline-level element
