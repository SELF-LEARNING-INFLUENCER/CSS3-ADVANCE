CSS display is the most important property of CSS which is used to control the layout of 
the element. It specifies how the element is displayed.
Overriding the default display value of an element is an important implication of the 
display property. For example, changing an inline-level element to be displayed as 
block-level element or changing the block-level element to be displayed as an inline-level 
element.
The CSS display block element takes as much as horizontal space as they can do that means the 
block element takes the full available width.The block value of the display property 
forces an element to behave like block-level element
