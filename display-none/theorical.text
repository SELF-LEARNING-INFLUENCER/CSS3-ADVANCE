CSS display is the most important property of CSS which is used to control the layout of 
the element. It specifies how the element is displayed.
Overriding the default display value of an element is an important implication of the 
display property. For example, changing an inline-level element to be displayed as 
block-level element or changing the block-level element to be displayed as an inline-level 
element.
The "none" value totally removes the element from the page. It will not take any space.
